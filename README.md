# dlibgit

This library provides an idiomatic D interface to the [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2) library. It is based on the [Deimos libgit2 bindings](https://github.com/s-ludwig/libgit2) and currently supports versions 0.19.0 and 0.20.0 of libgit2. This library is available as a [DUB package](http://code.dlang.org/packages/dlibgit).

This project was originally started by Andrej Mitrovic as a set of bindings to libgit2. He since started to implement a D wrapper interface, which was taken up by David Nadlinger. Since some time, SÃ¶nke Ludwig has continued the maintainership and completed most of the D API, moving the C bindings to a separate package to make the D API independent of libgit2's development.

## Changes

### v0.50.2 - v0.50.4

- Added `listRemotes`, `GitCommit.parents`, `GitCommit.parentOids`, `GitRemote.autoTag`, and a `SysTime` based overload of `createSignature`
- `GitObject` can now be converted to `GitTree` and to `GitTag`
- Various small fixes and improvements to exception handling in callbacks

### v0.50.1

- Added support for indexes, submodules and tags
- Time values are handled as `SysTime` objects now
- "Upcasts" from `GitObject` to specialized types, such as `GitCommit` are supported now
- `GitSignature` now has getter properties for all fields

### v0.50.0

- The version number has been incremented to be independent of the underlying libgit2 version - dlibgit aims to always support the latest versions of libgit2 under a unified API
- The D interface is about 70% finished
- All C bindings have been removed in favor of the separate Deimos package

### v0.19.0

- The new C-based bindings are now part of the `git.c` package.
- The `_object.d` and `_version.d` files have been renamed to `object_.d` and `version_.d`,
    as this is the usual D convention of naming modules that use D keywords.
- C-based documentation in the header files is now included with the .d files.
- Enums members can now be accessed both with their fully qualified name (e.g. `auto x = git_otype.GIT_OBJ_ANY`),
    and as if they were defined in module scope (e.g. `auto x = GIT_OBJ_ANY`).

## Notes

- Currently the opaque structs are defined as structs with a disabled default ctor, and a disabled
    copy ctor. Ordinarily opaque structs are defined via the `struct S;` syntax, however due to
    a compiler bug ([Issue 10497](http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=10497)) the
    alternative syntax had to be used.

## Requirements
[DMD] 2.063+.

## Dependencies

- Make sure you either clone with `git clone --recursive`, or if you've already cloned then use:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

### Windows:

- A pre-built version of the libgit2 DLL is included with the bindings package

### Posix:

- Get the libgit2 shared library with your package manager
- Or build `libgit2` manually.
- Making sure you install the right version of the libgit2 bindings (e.g. `dub fetch libgit2 --version=0.19.2` or `dub fetch libgit2 --version=0.20.1`)

## Building libgit2 manually

    $ cd <your-folder-of-choice>
    $ git clone git://github.com/libgit2/libgit2.git
    $ cd libgit2
    $ git checkout v0.20.0

- Then follow these instructions: https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2#building-libgit2---using-cmake
- You might need to install zlib if cmake says it's missing (On Posix use your package manager to find the `zlib dev` package).

### Additional Posix notes:

- Make sure the libgit2 shared lib path is in your ld conf file, for example on Linux Mint libgit2 installs to `/usr/local/lib`, so either edit `/etc/ld.so.conf` or run:

    ```
    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

## Building and running samples

### Samples

<span style="color: red">Note that the samples are not yet ported to the new D API and are currently absent from the repository</span>

**diff** sample:

    $ rdmd build.d diff/diff.d
    $ bin\diff.exe .git 2504016ab220b5b 1e8ffc04be048c0

- This will diff the first two commits in **dlibgit**.
- You could pass an absolute path, e.g. `C:/some/git/repo/.git`

**showindex** sample:

    $ rdmd build.d showindex/showindex.d
    $ bin\showindex.exe .git

**git client** sample:
**Note**: This sample has not been ported to v0.19.0 yet.

    $ rdmd build.d samples/network/git.d
    $ bin\git.exe ls-remote git://github.com/s-ludwig/dlibgit.git
    $ bin\git.exe index-pack path\to\.git\objects\pack\abcd1234.pack
    $ bin\git.exe clone git://github.com/s-dludwig/dlibgit.git ../../dlibgit2_clone

- `clone` is not the same as git's `clone` command, it does not deflate git object files.
- `fetch` doesn't currently work due to some bugs in network\fetch.d.
- Replace `path\to` with a valid path for index-pack.

On win32 some libgit functions work with either form of slashes, but you should prefer using forward slashes.

## Usage tips
As a convenience you can import `git.c.all` or `git.c` (with the new 2.064 package import feature) to import all modules at once.

## Documentation

You can use the libgit2 [API] docs. The [general] example is a good read.
