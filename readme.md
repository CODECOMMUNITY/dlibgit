# dlibgit - libgit2 D bindings

## Requirements
[DMD] 2.060+.
GDC support will be added soon.

### Windows:
You're already set.

### Posix:
You need to build the libgit2 shared library (a specific commit is required):

    $ git clone -b development git://github.com/libgit2/libgit2.git
    $ cd libgit2 && git checkout acd1700630ea1159a55dc5e8cee12e4a725afe18
    
- Follow these instructions: http://libgit2.github.com/#install

Make sure the libgit2 shared lib path is in your ld conf file.
For example, on Linux Mint libgit2 installs to /usr/local/lib, so either 
edit /etc/ld.so.conf or run:
  
    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

## Building and running samples

    $ rdmd build.d samples/diff/diff.d
    $ bin\diff.exe .git 2504016ab220b5b 1e8ffc04be048c0
    
- This will diff the first two commits in dlibgit.
- You could pass an absolute path, e.g. `C:/some/git/repo/.git`

Another sample:

    $ rdmd build.d samples/showindex/showindex.d
    $ bin\showindex.exe .git

Some libgit functions work with either form of slashes on win32, but you should prefer using forward slashes.

## Usage tips
As a convenience you can import `git2.all` or `git2._` to import all modules at once.

## Documentation

The D bindings aren't documented, but they're 1-to-1 equivalents of the C libgit2 library.
You can use the libgit2 [Guide] and its [API] docs.

[Guide]: http://libgit2.github.com/api.html

## Note
- The shared lib is built from commit `acd1700630ea1159a55dc5e8cee12e4a725afe18` in the [development] branch. Inline functions were re-created in D because they're not exported. Do not try to use a shared lib built from other commits without doing a diff and verifying that the inline functions are still the same in the D version as in C. The libgit2 master branch is out of date and might not compile.
    
- x64 support will be added later. It might already work but some int types are hardcoded due to how gccxml exports typeinfo. size_t and friends will have to be fixed to guarantee safe behavior.
    
These bindings were autogenerated by dgen, with minor edits required due to missing inlined functions. dgen is a work in progress, unreleased.
